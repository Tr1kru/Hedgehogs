			<h1>Hedgehogs as pets:</h1>
			<p>The most common pet species of hedgehog are hybrids of the white-bellied hedgehog or four-toed hedgehog.</p>
			<br>
			<p>However it is illegal to own a hedgehog as a pet in some US states including Hawaii, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and California, and some Canadian states, and breeding licenses are required.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Breeding licenses are required because in areas where hedgehogs have been introduced, such as New Zealand and the islands of Scotland, the hedgehog has become a pest. In New Zealand it causes immense damage to native species including insects, snails, lizards and ground-nesting birds, particularly shore birds. And the eradication of them is very difficult.</p>
			<br>
			<p>These restrictions exist in most European countries with the exception of Scandinavia. In Italy, it is illegal to keep wild hedgehogs as pets.</p>
