			<h1>Hedgehogs Reproduction and Lifespan:</h1>
			<br>
		<p>Depending on the species, the gestation period is 35–58 days. The average amount of newborns is 3–4 newborns for larger species and 5–6 for smaller ones. With many animals it is not unusual for an adult male hedgehog to kill newborn males.</p>
			<br>
		<p>Hedgehogs have a relatively long lifespan for their size. Larger species of hedgehogs live 4–7 years in the wild and smaller species live 2–4 years. Hedgehogs in captivity live 4–7 years compared to a mouse at 2 years and a large rat at 3–5 years. Lack of predators and with a controlled diet contributes to a longer lifespan in captivity 8–10 years depending on size.</p>
			<br>
		<p>Hedgehogs are born blind with a protective membrane covering their quills which then dries and shrinks over the next several hours. The quills emerge through the membrane after the hoglet has been cleaned or after the membrane falls off</p>
