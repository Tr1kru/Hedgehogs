			<h1>About the Hedgehog</h1>
			<br>
			<p>Hedgehogs are recognized by their spines which are hollow hairs made stiff with keratin. Their spines are not poisonous or barbed and unlike the quills of a porcupine and do not easily detach from their bodies.</p>
			<br>
			<p>However there is a process called "quilling" which is when the animal's spines normally fall out as they are replaced with adult spines. Their spines can also fall out due to disease and extreme strees.</p>
			<br>
			<p>All species of hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball in self-defense causing all of the spines to point outwards. The hedgehog's back contains two large muscles that control the position of the quills. When the creature is rolled into a ball the quills on the back of it protect the tucked face, feet, and belly, which are not quilled. And since the effectiveness of this strategy depends on the number of spines, some desert hedgehogs that evolved to carry less weight are more likely to flee or attack, ramming an intruder with the spines and rolling into a spiny ball for those species is a last resort.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Hedgehogs are fairly vocal and communicate through a combination of grunts, snuffles and/or squeals, depending on species.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Overall hedgehogs are interesting creatures, they make for good pets especially if your looking for a smaller and cute pet.</p>
